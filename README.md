# Numerical Optimization of Watson Function

This repo is the first homework for SYSU course _Numerical Optimization Method_ , which for the major Information and Computing Science, Grade 2015.

The working environment is as follows

- Windows 8.1 Home Basic
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Mathwork MATLAB 2016b
- Mathwork MATLAB 2014b
- Python 2.7.13
- Tensorflow 1.4.0-dev
- Numpy 1.13.3

All the MATLAB functions are in the root directory because it is more convenient to call them.

I am keeping a note as the time I writing this code in order to make the process more clear. The note is in Chinese Simplified.

It will be a report for the project when I finish all of the work. It will also be in Chinese.

The work is still under construction.

Some problems are still pending.
